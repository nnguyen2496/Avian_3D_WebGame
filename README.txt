Description: This is a 3D web game that I created as my final project for a
Computer Graphics tutorial that I took at Oxford University.

Instruction to install and run the game:
- Clone this folder.
- To load the game, open your terminal window and run: python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
- Open your web browser and go to the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/. 
- Press "Start" to play the game.
- Fly the eagle around and try to collect points by hitting on other creatures in the map. Points 
are given in the following scheme:
	+ A bat: 10 pts
	+ A humming bird: 20 pts
	+ A crane: 30 pts
- The eagle can be controlled with the following keys:
	+ SPACE: Move forward
	+ C: Move backward
	+ A: Move leftward
	+ D: Move rightward
	+ W: Move upward
	+ S: Move downward
- The relative position of the eagle to other creatures can be tracked via a navigation map in
the bottom left corner of the screen.
- Refresh the page to restart the game.
